# WSLCE
An algorithm to generate a PRN sequence belonging to family Weil-SLCE or WSLCE

In here, there is implementation of the WSLCE in Python, C, C++ and Verilog.

Primitive root generator code is implemented in Python but not C/C++ or Verilog. A prime number 'p' and a primitive root 'pr' is given as input. The output is a PRN binary sequence of length 'p'.
